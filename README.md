## Description

  Since Raspberry Pi is slow for image processing, you need another computer(let's call it Main PC).
  These codes in this repositly is for the Main PC for image processing.
  Codes runs in Raspberry Pi is [here](https://github.com/TenninYan/Self-driving-RC-car-raspi.git)

  You need Python and opencv in Main PC. For Raspberry Pi you need Python. Also you need a way to transfer images from camera on car. I used mjpg-streamer. If you put smartphone, I think you have another way.
